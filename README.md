# STUDENTS_MARK_PREDICTI
Students Mark Prediction is a way of predicting a student marks based on his/her previous marks.
The main objective for this project is to help teachers analyze students' performance easily and if needed, they can help her/him to improve their student’s performance by taking some actions like increasing their reading hours, giving some assignments etc..
The task is to collect the marks of each student and to store it in the data set. 
Students' marks of other subjects are taken as input for evaluating students’ performance. 
The dataset is pre-processed and features and labels are extracted from dataset, then the dataset is split in to test and train sets. 
To solve the problem of identifying the students who have a poor academic performance in exams and predict what students will learn from the class. 
This analysis model will help teachers identify how or to what extent their students perform differently so that teachers can choose appropriate teaching and pedagogical interventions to improve their teaching strategy. 
It also helps teachers to analyze the student's success and failure, who are getting the higher mark in the exam also is available here.
The linear regression algorithm technique using python will help in sorting and ordering the student data in the dataset.
